# Is AI Making Us Lazy?

Let’s be honest. AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot are powerful. You type a prompt, and you get an answer in seconds. Summaries, code, recipes, job descriptions, blog ideas — anything you want. It's fast. It feels productive. But here's the question that's been bothering me lately:

Are we actually learning anything? Or are we just outsourcing our thinking?

There's a difference between asking AI to help you think, and skipping the thinking entirely. What I see happening more and more is the second one. People get an idea, and before they even process it, before they reflect or try to work through it, they're already prompting the AI. It’s becoming instinct. And I think that’s dangerous.

## Thinking Is Effort

The human brain is lazy by default. That’s not an insult, it’s biology. We like shortcuts. If something requires effort, and there’s a tool that makes it easier, we take the tool. But when that tool becomes the default for every question or problem, we slowly lose our edge.

There’s a study that came out recently from Stanford, ETH Zurich, and MIT that actually backs this up. They found that when participants used AI assistants to write strategy memos, their work became faster and more polished… but also less original. People started relying on the AI not just to write, but to *think*. Creativity and problem-solving skills took a hit.

That’s the risk. When AI becomes the brain, not the assistant.

## The Line Between Use and Dependence

I’m not against AI. I use it. It helps me draft articles like this, find bugs, speed up research. But I try to ask myself one question first: **“Can I think this through on my own before I ask for help?”**

Sometimes I write an outline myself before checking what AI would suggest. Sometimes I build a plan, then refine it with AI. That way I’m still exercising the muscle. Because once you stop doing that, it gets weaker... like going to the gym less and less until one day you can’t lift your own weight.

## Final Thought

If the first thing you do when you're stuck is open an AI chat, pause. Give yourself 5 minutes. Try. Struggle a little. You might surprise yourself. And even if you don’t figure it out, you’ll at least remember what it feels like to think, LOL.

That's a muscle worth keeping.
