# Investing in Canada When You're Young

If you live in Canada and want to grow your money, you have access to some powerful tools. But the problem is that most people don’t learn how to use them. They open a savings account at the bank, they keep some cash there, and that’s it. The rest sits doing nothing. (And the value decreases because of inflation)

In this article, I’ll try to explain simply how investing accounts in Canada work, and which one to use depending on your situation. This is not advice. It’s just what I learned and what I wish I knew earlier.

## First: Why Investing Is Important

Inflation is real. Every year your money buys less. So keeping money under the mattress (or in a 0.05% savings account) is losing value slowly. Investing is a way to put that money to work.

But before investing, you should know *where* to put it. That’s where Canadian accounts like **TFSA**, **RRSP**, and **CELIAPP** come in.

## TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account)

TFSA is maybe the most flexible account. You can invest in stocks, ETFs, crypto(via ETFs), high interest savings,  almost anything. And the best part is: **your gains are not taxed**.

You can only contribute a certain amount to your TFSA each year, this is called your "contribution room". It starts accumulating from the year you turn 18, even if you don't open a TFSA right away. For example, if you turned 18 in 2018, by 2025 (age 25) your total contribution room would be $50,000 (assuming you were a Canadian resident for all those years and the annual limits didn't change). The annual limit is set by the government and can change each year.

You can take the money out anytime, for any reason, no penalty. And you get the room back the year after.

Note: Withdrawing money from your TFSA won't decrease your contribution room. For example, let's say your contribution room is 5000$ and you already deposited 4000 on the same year. If you decide to withdraw 2000$ and months later (of the same year) you want to deposit it back, you can only put 1000$. This is because withdrawing doesn't increase your contribution room. You have to wait until next year to do so.

Use this if:

- You're saving for something short-term or long-term
- You want flexibility
- You plan to grow your money without paying taxes

Almost everyone should max this account if possible.

## RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)

This one is more for retirement. When you put money in your RRSP, it **reduces your taxable income** now. You’ll pay less taxes this year. But later, when you retire and withdraw, you will be taxed on the money, as it will be considered as an income.

Use this if:

- You earn good income now and want to reduce taxes
- You don’t need the money soon
- You're thinking about long-term retirement

You can also use RRSP to buy your first home (there’s a special program), but the money must be paid back over time.

## FHSA (First Home Savings Account)

This one is new in Canada. It’s for people who want to **buy their first home**. It’s kind of a mix between RRSP and TFSA.

- You put money and get a **tax deduction** like RRSP
- But when you take it out to buy your first home, it’s **not taxed** like TFSA

You can only open it if you are **18+ and never owned a home** before. There are limits on how much you can put, but it’s very useful if you’re planning to buy in the next few years.

Use this if:

- You’re serious about buying your first property
- You want tax advantages and still flexibility
- You're young and starting to plan

## Risk On / Risk Off

When you’re young, you can take more risk. You have time to recover. You can invest in stocks, growth ETFs, maybe even some crypto.
There are many crypto related ETFs now, like BTC, ETH, SOL in canadian/us stocks exchange. So you can buy them in your TFSA and you won't be taxed !

The market goes up and down — but over 10, 20, 30 years, it usually goes up(almost always did!).

But as you get older, you need to be more careful. If you're close to retirement, you can't afford big drops. So people go more into bonds, GICs, stable investments. That’s called **risk off**.

So:

- If you’re 20–30: risk is ok (don’t be crazy, but don’t hide your money either)
- If you’re 40–50: start balancing
- If you’re 60+: protect your capital

## My Experience (Personal, Not a financial advice)


If you’re just starting:

1. For your **TFSA**: When you’re young, consider investing in select stocks, these can offer higher returns. As you get older, gradually switch to ETFs for more capital protection, even if the returns are lower.
2. Invest in your **RRSP** unless you see that you will start paying taxes on your income. If you do your own tax reports or use an accountant, there are tools available that can estimate how much tax you may owe. You can use these tools to plan your contributions and potentially save money instead of paying more in taxes. I personally use [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/tool/tax-calculator) to do the maths.
3. If you’re thinking of buying a house, invest in the **FHSA** instead of the RRSP, as you can withdraw your money earlier! (You can also transfer your money from the RRSP to the FHSA and vice-versa!).

Also, learn. Read. Watch videos. Follow people who explain things simply. Don’t follow hype. Avoid TikTok gurus, youtubers, and people selling their formation/ have paid groups. If they earn so much money, why do they need to get an additional income ?

## Final Words

Canada gives you tools to build your future. But it’s your job to use them right. Start small, be consistent, and don’t wait too long. Time is your best friend in investing.
